            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S among all the Civiliz'd part of Mankind, no Honors, and Commendations have been judg'd great enough to beſtow upon Virtue in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; ſo no task has been found more difficult and perplext, than to deduce it readily, and ſafely into all the ſingle Offices of Humane Life.</p>
            <p>Not to inſiſt at preſent on the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate bounden expreſſions of Piety towards God, about which men always have been, and needs muſt be at the greateſt loſs, where his own expreſs declarations conduct them not, from the infinite diſtance of the object: In the more common, and obvious inſtances of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54681:4"/> Juſtice, and Benignity one towards another, which moſt acknowledg in the groſs reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and advantagious; yet few are thought ſo happy, or ſo faithful, as to follow them by ſtraight, and uninterrupted lines in their ſeveral deductions, and to accommodate them aright to all the emergent caſes inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to our converſe one with another.</p>
            <p>After the relief, and directions lent us from Laws Divine, or Humane, the cleareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of God, the moſt ſtudied, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd Reaſonings of the wiſeſt of men ſpent therein, whether through ignorance, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, ſtubbornneſs, or malice, ſcarce any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hath been found ſo plain, any conviction ſo unexceptionable, which ſome men will not evade, or elude, firſt make intricate, and then fruſtrate, diſpute themſelves into a loſs about it, and then conclude with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a full exemption from it, and that in purſuit of every fancied (however lawleſs) intereſt, or groundleſs humor.</p>
            <p>Farther, The circumſtances of our actions are open to ſuch almoſt infinite variety, and accordingly the reaſons, and meaſures of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and our Obligations altering; It will be found a matter of ſome intricacy to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54681:4"/> moſt upright and wary, without danger or miſtake, duly and haſtily to apply all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral injunctions to each ſingle act. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after the largeſt proviſions of particular Precepts of all ſorts, ſome general Rules we have given to direct us, where others may come ſhort, or we ſeem at a loſs about them. Among which, none more full and comprehenſive than this of my Text, which hath gaind it the moſt univerſal admiration and applauſe, even from thoſe that obſerve, or thoſe that obſerve it not; from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as Friends to our ſacred profeſſion. So that <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aelius Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pridius.</hi> p. <hi>376.</hi> in vita ejus.</note> is reported to have Engrav'd it on the Walls of his Palace, and other Publick Buildings, as it were a ſtanding Law of his Empire, and the beſt ſquare of his own, and others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the Adminiſtration thereof. As our Lord in my Text declares it to have been of God himſelf under the Old Teſtament. He no leſs Eſtabliſhing it for future Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations under the New.</p>
            <p>In Treating of which I ſhall, Firſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the proper extent of this Rule, to vindicate it from ſome falſe applications, and aſſign it, as near as I can, its true boundaries.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54681:5"/>
            <p n="2">2. The apparent Reaſonableneſs, Juſtice, and Equity thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The plain eaſineſs, and ſuitableneſs of it to preſent uſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Divine Authority, and Sanction of it from the laſt words.</p>
            <p>In order to the former I obſerve, Firſt, This does not make other mens dealings with us, the Rule of our dealing with them.</p>
            <p>It is not whatſoever men do to you, but, <hi>Whatſoever ye would they ſhould do to you,</hi> &amp;c. Which otherwiſe might open a gap to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, fraud or violence. It muſt not paſs for a Maxim here, whatever it do in mens Practice, <hi>Fallere fallentem non eſt fraus.</hi> Men are very apt to think it a warrantable excuſe, in the worſt of their Actions, if they can but with any pretence ſay, I do but to him as he did to me, and give him, as they call it (I know not by what Figure) as good as he brought. So injuries, as well as animoſities, are multiplied, and bandied from one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and contrary to all other violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, loſe nothing, but gain ſtill more and more in their rebound. Another mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice or cruelty doth not warrant, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the nature of mine, and though he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54681:5"/> firſt, yet no Reaſon or Precept will juſtifie my following him therein, which the more I complain of, the greater diſtance I ought to keep from it: and if in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it be no more than what may be juſt for him to ſuffer, yet in all, it's more than I have power to inflict; not to mention how partial Judges, and Executioners men would be in their own Cauſes, while the juſteſt puniſhment, where it goes no farther, is not committed to every ones management; and private Revenge, in all Societies eſpecially, ſtands convicted by the Laws of God, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Compact; and can have no ſhelter from this. If in any caſe of extreme violence, I may, <hi>Vim vi repellere,</hi> rather Kill than be Killed, when openly Aſſaulted, againſt the common rights of Human Society, by Thieves and Murderers; It is not ſo much their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert as my neceſſity, that muſt bear me out, wherein all Reaſon, and all Laws of God and Man judg it more equal, that the guilty ſhould ſuffer, rather than the innocent, where one muſt preſently, and in ſuch an unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exigence, may have affixt ſomwhat of a Publick Character on the laſt for his moſt neceſſary defence. But where this may be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54681:6"/> otherwiſe ſecured, I muſt make my recourſe, and yield up my cauſe to the common guard, and moſt impartial determination of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and of Him above all that judges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, who hath ſaid <hi>Vengeance is mine:</hi> So I ſhould be willing to have done unto me, and if this ſeem to leave me under diſadvantage with thoſe who will not yet deal ſo with me; as it juſtifies them not in the leaſt, ſo will it more ſeverely condemn them for it hereafter; and in the mean time this reſtraint however uneaſie, may be lookt on as part of that <hi>Self denial,</hi> and <hi>taking up the Croſs,</hi> neceſſary not only to follow our Lord, but to enſure the peace and welfare of Humane Society.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our own will and deſire for other mens dealings with us, taken in the groſs may be oft an unwarrantable, and at other times an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Guide to ours with them. As if through any Diſtemper of body, or mind, prejudice, or miſapprehenſion, I wiſh for any thing that is really hurtful to my ſelf, I may not hence juſtly force it upon another. In oppoſition to which the Ancient Latin Copys,<note place="margin">T. <hi>4.</hi> De Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone Domini in monte. <hi>l. 2. p. 1168.</hi>
               </note> as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> obſerves, read it <hi>quaecunque bona,</hi> &amp;c. But becauſe it will be yet controverted, what theſe good things are, and how to diſtinguiſh them;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54681:6"/> and beſides the caſe of thoſe who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of judging of any Law; and for whom another reſtraint is provided; beſide the caſe of Inferiors, and Superiors, as ſuch, which admits different conſiderations, that I ſhall meet with in my next; The miſapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Rule in which our own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be apteſt, to impoſe on us, I reduce chiefly under this particular to two inſtances. I do not as I would be done unto, if I urge that upon another which he thinks hurtful, though I do not; becauſe I do not put my ſelf in his circumſtances, intirely, and ſo not to him, what I would expect from another, were I in his place, as this ſuppoſes.</p>
            <p>Again, When the ground of my deſire, or expectation is ſome other by-conſideration, and not the equity of the Caſe it ſelf. As when I am willing any ſhould do ſomwhat to me, that I may have the advantage of doing the like to him; which in effect proves not the ſame. If I think my ſelf ſtronger than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo ſhould deſire he might take from me, what he could, that I might have the ſame liberty towards him, or others; here I do not really, what I would be willing to ſuffer, and yet where this may be materially
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54681:7"/> the ſame, it varies much in the different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of perſons and other circumſtances, too many to reckon up. In all which, as in the caſe before, I do not truly, and fully put my ſelf in his place, and ſtead. In oppoſition to them, the order of the words is exactly to be obſerved; the firſt part to be conſidered by it ſelf abſolutely, and not to follow any ſiniſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the laſt, that is, abſtracted from other aims and deſigns: Whatever I ſhould chooſe, and think deſireable in it ſelf, and due to me in the ſame caſe, that I hereby bind my ſelf to, towards another, at leaſt when in my power. But not to invert the order of the words; Do what you will to any one, ſo you be willing they ſhould do it to you: Wherein we ſhall be eaſily miſtaken and blinded with prejudice and partiality, when we begin with that, and ſo proceed to this; as appears by too woful experience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I may reaſonably ſuppoſe this Rule given not ſo much for a compleat Syſtem of all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Equity: But rather as a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent relief, and Additionary Supply to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, wherein ſeems to be the beſt, and ſafeſt, and conſtant uſe of it; where we are to ſeek for any other, or wholly at a loſs about its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54681:7"/> there this may extricate us out of a great many doubts. For though I ſuppoſe moſt of the Precepts, which concern our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with each other, may be fairly deduced from this (of which more in the Cloſe,) yet if any do not preſently appear ſo, they do not thence loſe their Obligation, neither are we free to every Action, which our judgment may make reconcileable herewith. For the Authority of God, which binds antecedently to this, or any other Law, may lay many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of Duty upon me towards other men, which I may be apt to think I ſhould not require from any, nay be unwilling to receive. Again I may have ſomwhat impos'd upon me by my Lawful Superiors, which I may be inclin'd to judg, I ſhould not injoin on them. In which the Caſe is not left to even debate, or my judgment to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the reaſon of the thing alone, as it ſeems in the Text. In which alſo mankind are known naturally partial, and I may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed alſo more eaſily miſtaken than they, who ſtand upon much higher ground, and have a fuller and larger Proſpect of all about them, however the neceſſary Rights of juſt Authority to guard, and advance the true Honor and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54681:8"/> Service of God, and his Religion, with the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace, weigh much more (that I ſay not oblige much farther) than any private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or intereſt: and wherein nothing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely unlawful is enjoined, he that has the Commanding Power clears himſelf fully of this Rule, if, after all others, he do as he would be done unto, others cannot without that Reverence, and Obedience, which in like circumſtances they would expect from all, though they now obſtinately deny it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the wills and inclinations of men in their own concerns, as well as others, are oft fickle, and various, received upon very uncertain grounds, and governed by very unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prejudices, and it ſeems no way conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that the ſtrength of all Laws Divine, as Humane ſhould ſtand, or fall with ſuch weak and tottering ſupports, and be ſo long precarious, till they have ſtood their tryal, and received their doom from ſo frequent a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but always an inferior Judg. This Rule may ſuperadd a farther Obligation, but was never deſigned to exclude, or excuſe us from any former; where others fail this may ſupply the place of a particular injunction, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to ſomwhat beyond what we thought
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54681:8"/> ourſelves bound to before, not diſcharge us of any other Duty, ſeeing we can hardly imagine any good beyond what we wiſh to ourſelves, and are hereby ſo far engaged to others.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some have thought this rather a Rule of Juſtice, than Charity. Indeed one of the Oriental Tranſlations renders it <hi>quicquid aequum ducitis.</hi> The ground of their limitation is, that I may lawfully deſire, or be willing another ſhould give me all he can without prejudice to himſelf; But am not hereby bound to do ſo to every other man, nay cannot. Yet I am not willing ſo to reſtrain it, ſeeing the uſe, and deſign of it ſeems to reach Acts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as common Juſtice, it may be to join them in one. So the way of our Saviours introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and connecting it to the former Verſe, may more clear under the laſt particular. In the mean time, for the mentioned inſtance, I may be willing to receive, what I do not think another bound to give. So <hi>Whatſoever ye would</hi> in my Text, is, whatever ye think or judg reaſonable, and equitable to expect from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or that they are any way obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow; that reciprocally binds, and that in Juſtice too. But in Acts of Liberality, I ought even in my deſires to leave another, as free, as I would be my ſelf, to lay them out where
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54681:9"/> the beſt Prudence may direct him. Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a large, and diffuſive Principle, not to be tied up to one Method, or confined always to the ſame meaſures; <hi>ſeeketh not her own,</hi> much more with common Juſtice reſtrains our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting what is other mens. He that deſires always to be forgiven, and to be ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, had need be as free in giving to, or forgiving others; or elſe he will not only fall ſhort of the Mercy, he asks, but fall under the ſtroke of that Juſtice, he violates. So I think I may determine, I ought to beſtow that upon another, which interchangeably in the like caſe, I ſhould think it reaſonable for me to hope, and expect from him; or elſe my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, or actions will be obnoxious to more guilt, than ordinary partiality. So far of the Explication in General, which it would be endleſs to purſue into extreme niceties, more apt to perplex, and confound, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Precept to our readier obſervance.</p>
            <p>Yet more particularly by way of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe. No man is willing to be defrauded, or injured; to be impoſed on by falſhood, or treachery. None is deſirous to be reviled, or deſpiſed: every man is ſuppoſed to wiſh well unto himſelf; to have his perſon, and all that appertains to him ſafe from outward
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54681:9"/> violence, or ſecret fraud; an evil eye, or as bad a Tongue, to have his Actions interpreted in the moſt favourable ſence, they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: all his good things advanc't; his evil as much as may be diminiſh't: In all inſtances go and do likewiſe. <hi>(Nemo cùm ignorantiâ tenetur, non cupit doceri; quum libatur, amanter ac ſecretò moneri, potius quam traduci; nemo quum eget, non velit ſibi ſubveniri: Nemo velit obtrectari famae ſuae; Nemo fraudari,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eraſmus par.</hi>)</p>
            <p>I am in the ſecond place to conſider the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent reaſonableneſs, juſtice, and equity of the Rule, which has all the evidence poſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to the Univerſal approbation of mankind. Indeed it lies ſo near the firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Originals of all right Reaſon, and Equity, that it ſeems hard to derive it from any more clear, and ſelf-evident, and ſo far difficult to prove, as to find any other propoſition, that leſs needs proving: and yet ſome ſuch imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ones, we muſt have recourſe to, or elſe all diſcourſe muſt be fruitleſs, we can have no foundation whereon to begin, or end to ſtop at. It hath oft fared the worſe with very important Truths, for lying near the Fountain head of all; while through Pride, Obſtinacy, or vain Curioſity, ſome men will hardly receive the prime verities of Nature, as well as Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54681:10"/> without requiring a previous proof, which all men are not alike happy in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, nor bind themſelves to the ſame Methods therein: Neither are under the ſame appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Principles, and their conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; of which others, (though moſt unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably) have taken ſuch advantage, as more to diſtruſt, or contemn that proved, which barely propounded, they could not but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. The propoſition in my Text, ſeems as liable to run this hazard (if it have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſuffered thereby) as moſt others; which therefore I rather premiſe, that it may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go no prejudice by my ſhort offers, which I reduce to a ſmall compaſs: and in which every ones own Meditations may add what poſſibly to him may ſeem more convincing.</p>
            <p>Now with reſpect to thoſe who (if any) are moſt like to object againſt it, I may begin by conſidering how reconcileable it is with their own deareſt (if not only) Principle of Self-Love ſuppoſed therein, and truely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed thereby: than which nothing with ſuch may, ſooner conclude it reaſonable. For becauſe it's taken for granted, that as we do, ſo we ought to wiſh well unto ourſelves, and can hardly knowingly do otherwiſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's made the faireſt Rule, but not the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54681:10"/> only or beſt ground of our dealing ſo with others. Wherefore they who moſt contradict the purport of it towards them; are as rigid, and haſty as any, in exacting it towards themſelves. When we are bid <hi>to love our Neighbour as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> it's implied as we do, ſo we muſt and cannot but love ourſelves: Whereto infinite Appeals are made in all parts of Religion; and were it not preſuppoſed inviolably ſtrong, and univerſal, the Bands of Humane Society, and Commerce, as Converſe would be much looſened, which are now more ſtraightned by this Precept: We are hereby more than warranted to will what is good to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, while our doing it to others is ruled thereby; which (as all commands rightly conſidered) is ſo far from claſhing with true Self-Love, that it proves its ſafeſt guard. We do not what we ought by this Rule to others, if we wiſh not what is really beſt to ourſelves. But if this reach not the evidence of an intire proof, it may remove a conſiderable preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice out of its way, which not done, ſcarce any other would be admitted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To proceed gradually in matters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is no neceſſary competition between my own and my Neighbours concerns, that is, where mens intereſts do not really interfere,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54681:11"/> or what I do to another takes nothing properly from my ſelf, which yet oft happens, there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can carry more unexceptionable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, than the Precept before us. As for inſtance to give good words, rather than bad; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, and benign, rather than peeviſh, and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; to be more forward to comfort, than to vex; to heal, than to wound, to lift up, rather than to beat down; to conceal, rather than to expoſe anothers imperfections; to defend, ſooner than to accuſe; yea in many Offices of Beneficence, wherein I may relieve anothers neceſſity, or much promote his convenience, by that which I cannot keep, or if I do, it muſt be uſeleſs, or ſo inſignificant, that I ſhall be aſhamed to own it.</p>
            <p>In theſe and ſuch like inſtances, what can carry greater conviction, than that the one part is more excellent, and eligible than the oppoſite, and yet almoſt as ſoon, and eaſily done? For I appeal to the moſt ſtupid, and prejudic'd, is it not better to ſave Life, than to deſtroy it? to be an inſtrument of anothers hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, than miſery? to love, than to hate? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, to do good, than to do evil? If there be no difference in things at all, but only in our Opinions: if, abſtracted from other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, one includes as much perfection as the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54681:11"/> other (for what dare not ſome men aſſert?) Why in our own behalf are we ſo conſtantly determined in our choice to the one? ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of, and ready to fly from the other? need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither force of Argument, or length of Meditation to ſecure our preference. An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Conviction, that they are as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in their own Natural tendency as our thoughts; and that we can as ſoon ceaſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire what is good, as ſuch, as not think it to be placed in thoſe things, which this Rule directs us in to all. Now if what I wiſh to my ſelf, or would have others do to me be better than the oppoſite (or elſe why do I chooſe it?) then by the ſame reaſon it is better to all, and at leaſt when my own prejudice, or intereſt comes not between, I have no pretence of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that involves not a contradiction; and accuſe my ſelf of the breach of all the Laws of Conſcience, Reaſon, and Equity, if I do not what I cannot but judg, and do ſo every day, really beſt, and moſt eligible.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In other Caſes where my thus dealing may ſeem to reſtrain thoſe benefits, which otherwiſe I could wiſh to my ſelf, yet is it moſt reaſonable, and equal, that the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of Humane Life ſhould be diſtributed by ſuch meaſures, while no axiom upon which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54681:12"/> Mathematical demonſtration is built can plead clearer evidence than the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this. If there it muſt be received as undeniably and immutably true. <hi>Si aequalia aequalibus addas, tota ſunt aequalia. Si ab aequalibus aequalia demas, quae remanent erunt aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</hi> The ſame is this, at leaſt on the one ſide, changing but things into perſons, <hi>paria paribus conveniunt: like things agree to like perſons.</hi> So that whatever is fit for, or due to me, muſt be by the ſame reaſon for, and to another in the ſame circumſtances. All men naturally, as ſuch, are equal, ſtand upon even terms, and level ground; and if Society, Compact, and the conſequences thereof have made any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the conditions of men, that alters not the Caſe here; becauſe the preſent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept puts, or ſuppoſes us intirely in the ſame ſtate, or capacity, ere it determine, or equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize our mutual dues, and obligations.</p>
            <p>So that as ſure as there is any ſuch thing as right or wrong, reaſonable, or unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, equal, or unequal, and thoſe muſt be as certain, and evident as any other Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatever; of agreeable, or diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; beneficial, or hurtful; true, or falſe; ſtraight, or crooked, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which all Self-Love muſt derive from the ſuppoſed dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54681:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> of, and ſubſiſt by: So unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly muſt the better part be involved in this direction.</p>
            <p>But that I may begin, and end with ſame perſons here (who too oft before make violent attempts upon thoſe fixt boundaries, and ſo are like to be little moved by ſuch Topicks) I add in the Fourth and Laſt place, in their own way of reaſoning, There is no other poſſible Foundation of Society, and ſo of Peace, and Self-preſervation involved therein, than the ſuppoſed obſervance of this Law. For if you love your ſelf, ſo does every one beſide, and may do as much, and therefore can never be ſuppoſed to agree in any thing, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides not equally for his concerns as yours, and puts him not in a like capacity of enjoying what he deſires. I appeal to the moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, whether all perſons are like to meet in what only takes care for one, or whether any other Rule, or miſapplication of this, give ſo large as well as ſo equal, a proviſion for more, yea for all; ſo that it has not only as much of abſtracted reaſon, but of private intereſt, and ſafety, as it's poſſible for any general one to have; wherein alone the concerns of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity are moſt nearly united: and does not only follow that order in which God, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54681:13"/> have plac'd us: But the other fancied Originals of Society fall in pieces without it.<note place="margin">

            <p n="3">3. What may yet farther commend this Rule is its plain eaſineſs, and ſuitableneſs to preſent uſe; while Laws, if otherwiſe never ſo rational, and uſeful, if withall obſcure, perplext, and over-numerous, may prove a ſnare, rather than a ſupport; make more Controverſies than they decide; loſe much of their ſtrength, and force by being ſpun

In contradiſtinction to which, and ſuch like inconveniencies, here is a Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at hand, which every man carries about in his own breaſt, legible to him that knows no Letters, open and obvious to the moſt rude and ignorant, which the worſt memory cannot forget, the ſuddeneſt ſurprize prevent, nor the moſt wilful blindneſs conceal: to come at which, we are not forced to ſearch Ancient Records, or dark Repoſitories; to revolve and ruminate upon old dark ſentences, or new fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner gloſſes; not to rove about the world to examine the various Cuſtoms and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Countries; not to ſoar as high, as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or dive as low, as Hell, in queſt of our Duty; after all other pains return into your ſelf, and look into your own heart, where you may oft find it ſooner, and read it clearer than any where beſide.

            <p>Again, this will readily deſcend to each ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Caſe, and may be eaſily accommodated to every emergence thereof, which other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts muſt infinitely, and endleſly multiply in their attempts towards: However involved with difficulties, or full of various windings and turnings, this queſtion is ſoon ask'd, and almoſt as ſoon anſwer'd, What we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and expect to be done unto us <hi>(rebus ſic ſtantibus)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Neither lies there any exception againſt ſo ſuitable a Precept, according to which we are made our own Judges, and our own Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers; our own Accuſers, or our own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgators; can you deſire more kind, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent,

What you have already judged beſt, when to be done to you, is it quite contrary, when to be done by you, and the caſe in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe altered? So that whatever ſuſpition, or prejudice may lie againſt any other, none ſure can againſt our own voice, and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which this only ties us up to. Wherefore no Precept can be conceiv'd preſt with fewer incumbrances, darkned with leſs intricacy, open to larger uſe, readier to preſent applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, more obvious to all apprehenſions, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſupply all other defects and loſſes, and more ſafely to interpret moſt other injunctions, than this of my Text. <hi>Summa omnium quae do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet lex, &amp; Prophetae, quos ſi aut non vacat, aut per inſcitiam non poteſt evolvere, habet domi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulam,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his Paraphraſe.</p>

But if any thing ſeem ſtill wanting to compleat the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſtabliſhment of it for a Law, and to raiſe a more Religious Veneration to its Obſervance, that is abundantly ſupplied by this laſt clauſe: this is not only to act agreeably to the moſt improved Reaſon, but alſo Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor meerly to follow the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but of God over and above: being ſtrengthened by this his double Sanction, which twofold Cord ſure is not eaſily broken; to its own intrinſick lovelineſs, it hath all the poſitive enforcements, and authority of an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Heavenly injunction, <hi>This is the Law;</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In which words our Saviour ſeems to go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet. It is not only a ſingle Command, however ſolemnly Enacted in the Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and renewed by the ſucceeding Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; but as it were the ſum, and recapitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole: As if all together reduc'd into one ſhort <hi>Epitome,</hi> and <hi>Breviate,</hi> running through every Precept, and almoſt as oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, as there are any Inſtructions given; So that go through the intire Scripture, at leaſt that part of it which concerns our deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards each other, whereſoever you pitch, on whatſoever you ſit, you cannot but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54681:16"/> meet the true purport, and deſign of this; though not in the ſame terms, yet in ſence. So that if all the Offices, and ſingle Duties of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life ſcattered in the Sacred Volumes, may be included in one common direction, it can hardly be done in fewer words, and more comprehenſive of all, than this.</p>
            <p>Alſo it's not only the Law, and the Prophets, but the Goſpel too, where our Lord moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly enjoins it, here, and in St. <hi>Luke</hi> vi. 31. and ſome Copys added it to the Apoſtolick Cannons, <hi>Acts</hi> xv. 29. His Precepts alſo are more nearly ſuited, and accommodated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, where there ſeems any difference, being more covertly, and by conſequence deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of old. Wherefore ſome Copys Read it in my Text <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſo, or to this effect are the Law, and Prophets; others, as we, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>This is the Law,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here I ſhall, (1.) mark out ſome general Commands of each Teſtament, which ſeem of the ſame import with this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Univerſal extent aſcribed to ſuch Commands.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How far involved in other more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and remote.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The relation it may ſtand in to, and the influence it hath upon even the Duties of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54681:16"/> Firſt Table, which we owe moſt immediately to God himſelf, to give it ſo great a Character, as in the cloſe of my Text.</p>
            <p>In order to the firſt may be obſerved indeed, that it is no where in expreſs terms in the Old Teſtament, or the Canonical Books; that which comes neareſt, is in the Apocryphal, <hi>Tobit</hi> v. 15. <hi>Do that to no man which thou hateſt,</hi> where the negative part of it, is ſomwhat the ſame. But the poſitive ſence is in many places, as <hi>Levit.</hi> xix. 18. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> oft referred to in the New Teſtament. Now no conſequence can be more direct and natural, than that if we love him as our ſelves, we ſhall do to him what we would have done to our ſelves, that only in the ſtrictneſs of the Letter, determining the inward Principle, and Diſpoſition of the mind; this the outward ſuitable Expreſſion thereof, and Action. To the ſame purpoſe may be Interpreted thoſe many places concerning not only their Juſt, but Charitable, Humane, and Friendly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment towards all, eſpecially the Poor, the Widow, the Fatherleſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> xv. 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, the ſtranger, and their very ſervants, <hi>Deut.</hi> xvi. 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> While it comes in ſo often in the cloſe, and as the ſtrongeſt enforcement of all, <hi>Thou ſhalt remember thou was a bond-man, or a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54681:17"/> ſtranger in the Land of</hi> Egypt; implying their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to recollect, what though they had not, yet they could not but have wiſht for, and might reaſonably have expected to have been done to them, and therefore ſo ſhould now do to others; nay this very conſideration is expreſly annext to the fore-cited Precept of loving our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor as our ſelves, <hi>Levit.</hi> xix. 34. Alike may be applied that concerning helping an Enemy in his diſtreſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxiii. 4. Yea moſt in the beginning of that Chapter, ſo alſo concerning not rejoycing at his calamity. <hi>Prov.</hi> xxiv. 17. Yea rather multiplying benefits upon him. <hi>Prov.</hi> xxv. 21. So the Pſalmiſts appeal and profeſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> vii. 4. <hi>If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me,</hi> &amp;c. See alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> xiii. 3. <hi>Remember them in bonds as bound with them, and them which ſuffer adverſity as your ſelves in the body:</hi> To omit others in the New Teſtament, where many things ſeem added; to return Good for Evil; Bleſſing, for Curſes; to love them that hate us, to be merciful and kind to all, even the unthankful; leſs cannot, more may, be included, than what is here expreſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The large extent aſcribed to ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, eſpecially in the New Teſtament, ſuitable to the declaration in my Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxii. 36, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in anſwer to that queſtion, <hi>Which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54681:17"/> is the great Commandment of the Law?</hi> Our Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, firſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c. and the ſecond is like unto it, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf, on theſe two Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi> So <hi>Mark</hi> xii. 30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuitably St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and more cloſe to my Text, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 14. <hi>For all the Law is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in one word, even in this, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> which St. <hi>James,</hi> c. ii. 8.9. calls the Royal Law, which fulfilling we ſhall do well. Again others particularly are ſummed up in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiii. 9. After reckoning up the five negative Precepts of the ſecond Table, he ſubjoins, <hi>If there be any other Commandment, it's briefly comprehended, or recapitulated in this ſaying, namely, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> In the Verſe before, <hi>He that loveth another hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Law;</hi> in the Verſe after, <hi>Love is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law.</hi> So our Lord ſeems to ſum up many in it, <hi>Matth.</hi> xix. 18, 19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Other Precepts more remote ſeverally involve the ſame ſence with this, whatever expreſſions of Juſtice, and Charity are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for in them ſingly, are here univerſally, and together; that is for inſtance, juſt Weights and Meaſures, an equal Ballance, that we <hi>have not an Ephah, and an Ephah,</hi> as the Hebrew phraſeth the falſe and deceitful, one to buy, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54681:18"/> another to ſell with, ſo in all other caſes moſt ſtraightly forbid, as a plain intrenchment upon this Rule, not doing as we would be done by. So to be true to our truſt, to ſpeak as we think, and act as we ſpeak, to do violence to no man, to defraud, defame, or reproach none, to preſerve every ones dues, and ſecure his right, what is it but to keep cloſe to this Rule? Alſo to find pity, and relief in our diſtreſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; to have our wounds cloſed, and not widened; our diſtractions compoſed, and not heightned; our miſery as much as may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, and our happineſs advanc'd, are every ones choice for himſelf, and ſo more become his Duty to others. It were eaſie to go through moſt Commands, take almoſt any of them ſeverally, and conſider what it is they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join upon all, and bethink your ſelves whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you would not chooſe it rather than the contrary; in all caſes to receive your due, oft over and above, good will, and friendly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from all; and can any thing be as more equal, ſo more deſirable?</p>
            <p>If there be any caſe like an exemption, it ſeems that of ſevere, eſpecially capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which as they are not excluded by all the Precepts of Chriſtian mercy, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which would be cruelty to the far greater,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54681:18"/> as better part (and this muſt not as I ſaid, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted to certainly vacate, and fruſtrate any other;) ſo though he that ſuffers may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly always deſire pardon, and think himſelf as ready univerſally to give it: Yet he that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts it, being under leſs prejudice, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that were he in the ſame caſe, he ought not to expect it, and that where ſo many others are concerned, by this Rule barely, it can hardly be in his power always to give it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In order to the enlargement of this Rule, and it's truly Religious, and Spiritual, as meer Moral worth, may be conſidered the reſpect it bears to, and the influence it hath upon even the Duties of the Firſt Table immediately to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, which though not directly, yet by ſome conſequence may be included, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed therein. This contains an univerſal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Juſtice, and Equity; of giving to every one what belongs to him, is due and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to his ſtate; and ſo may be applied to all acts of Piety indiſpenſably due to God, as ſuch, without the almoſt Blaſphemous preſumption of but ſuppoſing our ſelves in his place. Alſo the true love of our Neighbour, which this ſuppoſes, and expreſſes, muſt be founded in, and can only be preſerved, and quickned by the true love of God, which is the ſum of the firſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54681:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> Table: But theſe I need not purſue, nor yet St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Argument in the matter in hand, <hi>Qui proximum diligit,</hi>

            <p>In the mean while may be obſerved, the Scripture ſeems much more frequent, and partial in ſtating the mutual Offices we ow each other in acts conſequent on this Rule, than the immediate outward expreſſions of Devotion towards God; ſeldom expoſtulates the want of theſe, but the defect of thoſe fill the Law, and the Prophets, and the Goſpels too with complaints. See the firſt of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> throughout, and many more exhorting them to ſhow the truth of their Religion, that Faith, that Fear, and Love of God in acts of Juſtice, and Mercy, rather than Pompous Oblations, or Adorations, of which among others may be conſulted, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxi. 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> vii. 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> xxii. 16. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> vi. 6. <hi>Mich.</hi> vi. 7, 8. <hi>Mark</hi> xii. 33. So in the account which our Saviour gives of the proceedings of the laſt day, (<hi>Matth.</hi> xxv. lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end) all the ſentences to the good or bad, are proportioned to the obſervance, or breach of theſe.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:54681:19"/>
            <p>And as our future doom, ſo the ſucceſs of our preſent Praiers, and Devotions is made much to depend on this performance. In which may be obſerved the connection of this Verſe to the foregoing, in that it is, <hi>If ye being evil know how to give good gifts unto your Children, how much more ſhall your Father which is in Heaven, give good things to them that ask him? Therefore all things,</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay, there is nothing wanting to ſecure your petitions from diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, but your not anſwering other mens equal requeſts from you. God is infinitely more good, and ſo more ready to ſupply you, than the moſt indulgent Parent his own Son. But if you expect God ſhould fulfil your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, you muſt (if I may ſpeak it with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) his. He is far removed in perſon, and can receive nothing properly from you; in part therefore transfers his right to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for their neceſſary ſupport, and makes your dealing with them, the ordinary Rule, and Meaſure of his Diſpenſations to you. That this is no forc'd interpretation (inſiſted particularly on by St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> on my Text) appears by other expreſs places; our Lords reflection upon his own prayer, <hi>Matth.</hi> vi. 14. 15. <hi>If ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give men their Treſpaſſes, your Heavenly Father will alſo forgive you,</hi> &amp;c. and to the ſame purpoſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54681:20"/> he denounces upon the omiſſion, Ch. xviii. 35. In which alſo may be farther conſulted, <hi>Matth.</hi> vii. 1, 2. <hi>Luke</hi> vi. 37, 38. <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 1, 2, 3. By which and divers like, he ſhews how much he makes our actions dependant on this Rule, the ſquare of his diſtributions, whether of Juſtice, or Mercy; and that he meaſures chiefly our performances even of Piety to himſelf, and mainly proportions our after-rewards, and hopes from him by theſe like Offices, more than by other even directer and immediate outward expreſſions of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to himſelf; which he ſeems ſparing in requiring or commending; cautious in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to their utmoſt bounds; or cheriſhing every plauſible pretence thereto, farther than may ſtrongly guard, and miniſter Spiritual Life to the other; knowing how oft we are miſtaken, how eaſily ſeduc'd out of the way, how ſoon tranſported beyond our line in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to ſuch raiſed, and ſtill aſpiring Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and how unfit ordinarily we are to manage, and govern them, eſpecially in the higheſt tranſports towards ſuch objects, ſo much above the level of Human circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: that when ſincere, but not the beſt grounded, or guarded, yet rarely are they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt with ſome Allay of Superſtition, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54681:20"/> But when heedleſly indulg'd, and let looſe, ſoon paſs into the moſt Phrenſical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances. Wherefore the Scripture ſeems to take more care to fence in, than miniſter fuel to thoſe however ſacred flames; and expreſſes moſtly our Duty to God in general terms, and inward acts of <hi>loving him with all your heart, fearing him, walking humbly with him,</hi> &amp;c. But Offices of Righteouſneſs, and Charity fill every page, are more poſitive, punctual, and expreſs; the chief ſubject matter of Laws reſpecting us in ſociety, wherein we ſtand upon even terms one with another; and the effects of which are preſently, and ſenſibly beneficial, the ſtay and ſupport of mankind; the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of all the comforts of this Life, and the moſt advantageous opportunity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the next. So though this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſeem literally, and moſt ſtrictly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Second Table only: yet hath it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſignatures, and evidences of the completi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Firſt: The Bond of all Society, and neareſt Original of all Juſtice, and Equity: The grand Pattern, and exemplar of all Laws, and Conſtitutions: The Epitome of our whole Duty revealed, or innate: The Law, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Goſpel in one: The <hi>end of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:</hi> The faireſt tranſcript of the firſt, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54681:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>everlaſting Righteouſneſs:</hi> The moſt perfect ſummary of Gods will, and the exacteſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his preſent, and after Diſpenſations; which may juſtly give it ſo high a Character in the cloſe of my Text. <hi>This is the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence we may, firſt, admire the moſt apparent Equity, and impartiality of the Divine Laws, that ſo unexceptionably, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally as much as poſſible provide for the good of all: God As one common Parent producing all alike, ſo equally takes care of, and guards the Concerns of all; and made their happineſs run in the ſame Channel, that one part might not rejoyce alone, nor be put to ſeek, nor hope to find it apart from others: Thus forcing us into all amicable Society ſuppoſed, and much ſtrengthned by theſe prime dictates of God and Nature: adding all the force of his authority and injunction to faſten our mutual dependences, and enlarge the moſt diffuſive felicity. He has thus given every other man as ſure hold of, and as good an intereſt in you, as you in him; and made your willingneſs to receive, an equal obligation in you to give, and ſo may appeal to your own judgment, <hi>Are not my ways equal?</hi> ſhews that he is no reſpecter of perſons in what
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54681:21"/> he commands, no more than in what he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here alſo we ought to adore the infinite condeſcenſion of our great Law-giver, that not only makes his own will, but our will our law; and ſhews how tender he is of our good, that he makes our own deſires the frequent meaſure of his Precepts; and how far he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the welfare of his creatures, in that he abridges them not the loving and doing good to themſelves,<note place="margin">
